To make it easy for you to create files using templates, there are easy commands that you can use.

We are using a file generator called [Plop](https://plopjs.com/documentation/).

To run a list of file generators that is accessible in this project, just run:

```bash
npm run plop
```

or

```bash
npx plop
```

Note: make sure that npx is installed by running

```bash
npm i -g npx
```

You can also right click on the file structure at the right and choose `New File from Plop Template`. Take note that you need
[Plop File Templates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SamKirkland.plop-templates) installed as an
extension to make it work.
